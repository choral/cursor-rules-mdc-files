# Router Rules

- Use `APIRouter` to group routes by domain or resource.
- Each router file should contain a `router` instance and register it with tags.
- Do not include business logic directly in route handlers.
- Use `Depends()` to inject service classes into handlers.
- Keep routers lightweight and focused on I/O.

## Sample Code
```
router = APIRouter(prefix="/users", tags=["users"])

@router.get("/", response_model=List[UserOut])
def list_users(service: UserService = Depends()):
    return service.get_all()

```
