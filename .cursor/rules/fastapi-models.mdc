# Model Rules

- Use SQLAlchemy ORM models and inherit from `Base`.
- Use `__tablename__` to define table names explicitly.
- Use type annotations for all columns.
- Group related models by domain if necessary.

## Sample Code
```
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String, nullable=False)
```
